<h4>All you need for painless trading bot developing</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*G5ilTb2ZHS0o0M4MNfyKBw.png" /></figure><p>Have you ever dreamed about writing a cross-exchange crypto arbitrage bot? Or maybe you want to diversify risks by making your bot perform on several exchanges simultaneously? Or your bot’s decision model depends on complex data sources, like Twitter or some blockchain?</p><p>Two years ago, we started developing our bot-fleet. At some point, it began to work and gain income, but we discovered that we spend more resources on issues in infrastructure than on bots’ algo and strategy. At this point, we decided that the infrastructure is an even more valuable product than the bot itself.</p><p>Now we are happy to introduce our <a href="https://cryptoring.tech/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=prealpha_press_release">CryptoRing Platform</a> to our early adopters. It’s an all-in-one solution for creating crypto trading bots and other software.</p><p>It includes</p><ol><li>real-time data streams from:</li></ol><ul><li>centralized and decentralized crypto exchanges (trades, order book updates, etc)</li><li>blockchains</li><li>social media and news sources like Twitter, Reddit and others</li></ul><p>2. unified trading API for top crypto exchanges</p><p>3. marketplace for apps you create (probably)</p><p>4. runtime for bots and apps (maybe)</p><p>5. anything else you suggest to be useful</p><p>It’s still pre-alpha now, and we are working hard to make it stable and production-ready as soon as possible. But we can’t do it without you and your feedback.</p><p>As compensation for help and patience, early adopters get all ready functionality for free until the platform becomes production and an “ambassador” status that will give them access to the newest features and some privileges in the future.</p><p>You can sign-up <a href="https://cryptoring.tech/register?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=prealpha_press_release">here</a>.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=fd38d4201e" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/cryptoring/cryptoring-all-in-one-crypto-trading-platform-fd38d4201e">CryptoRing: all-in-one crypto trading platform</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/cryptoring">CryptoRing Platform</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
