**Happy second birthday [Lama Bot (‡Ωë‡æ≥‡ºã‡Ωò‡ºã‡Ωñ‡Ωº‡Ωè‡ºç)](https://t.me/compassion_lama_bot)!!**

In Lama's case second birthday is not a 2 years anniversary but a day when second version of Lama Bot is ready to help you our dear users and supporters. 

Now it works on its own platform which gives us a lot of freedom to make it better on day to day bases and be sure that we can keep our promises.

It's high time to start publishing [link to Lama Bot](https://t.me/compassion_lama_bot) again.

And I promise that it is going to be free for its users forever and won't be used for any type of advertisement. I'm going to handle all expenses for it myself. 

üôè But in exchange, I want you to promise that you are going to use it only as a spiritual and mental health teacher but not like a "free access to GPT". 

‚ÄºÔ∏è **I feel myself free to bun for abusing Lama Bot and any incorrect usage!** But I hope I'll never do it.

**üôè Thank you for your support ** 

See you in livestream in January. I'll announce it as usual in [X (Twitter)](https://x.com/T0ha666) and [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@t0ha). And recently I've added [ü¶ã BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/t0ha.ru) to this list.
