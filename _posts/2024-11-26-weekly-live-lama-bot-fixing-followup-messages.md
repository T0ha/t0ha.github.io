This week we were fixing follow-up messages Oban routines. We were discovering an open-source ObanWeb but it seems like it's still not.

Next Tuesday (2024-12-03) at 9:00 UTC we are going to add log-in to admin through telegram command and prepare for deployment. If we have time we'll build a docker image. After that I'll deploy it myself. This process needs too much sensitive information to do it in public.
See you on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/war1and) and [YouTube](https://youtube.com/live/IElMh9TC944?feature=share).
