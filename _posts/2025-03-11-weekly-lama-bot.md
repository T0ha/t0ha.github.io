This week we finished a simple [landing page for Lama Bot](https://lamabot.io?utm_source=t0ha.ru&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=weekly). It's very simple but clear due to [X comments](https://x.com/T0ha666/status/1899489552563417219) .  The next step with it is to generate it directly from the bot's settings but it's not a priority for now.

It's time for promotion and marketing now. I'm going to spread Lama Bot all over catalogs on the Internet and launch on PH, Uneed and others. Wish me luck and don't forget to upvote ðŸ˜‰. Let's connect on [BSky](https://bsky.app/profile/t0ha.ru).

Next Tuesday (2025-03-10) at 10:00 UTC we are going to work on tests and code quality. It's needed since updating Phoenix and stuff becomes crucial. 

See you on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/war1and).
