üíª This week I've mostly finished fixing timing issues in [TelemetryMetricsMnesia](https://github.com/T0ha/telemetry_metrics_mnesia) library for Elixir. Bought a monitor, keyboard and mouse 

üèÉ We achieved 1.5 km milestone this week. Next ones are 2x1 and 2 km.

üî¨ PhD studies are mostly finished this academic year. I'm going on with modelling for my theses. For this I've finished 3 online courses in 3 days. This process doesn't even smell like learning. It's just finishing course. But as a result I found out new topics I want to enhances my knowledge in.

üìΩÔ∏è I've added a countdown timer to streams. My max viewers are 4 per stream this week. It seems to be an achievement. I've been streaming  [Rock. Code. (N)VIM.](https://www.twitch.tv/war1and) on daily basis this week. Publishing the sessions to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX764RemXwZZ_XfWfV8tq1PvoM4Ebcdo8).

ü™∑ This week I was practicing shamatha up to 20 min and Loving Kindness mostly.

ü§ñ Configuring  [Taskade AI](https://www.taskade.com/?via=t0hashvein) to help me to manage blog and social network routine. I'll write an article about it later.

 üìø [Lama Bot (‡Ωë‡æ≥‡ºã‡Ωò‡ºã‡Ωñ‡Ωº‡Ωè‡ºç)](https://t.me/compassion_lama_bot) has 4 daily active users for now. It's definitely a success! I'm learning a lot about happiness, Buddhism and AI to improve it.
