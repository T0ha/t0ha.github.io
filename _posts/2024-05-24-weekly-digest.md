This is a Holy week for Buddhists since May, 23 is the 15th day of Saga-dava. This day is known as a Buddhas birth, enlightment and leaving for paranirvana (death) day. For me it was a day for small meditation retreat. I was meditating about 3 hrs. Since I'm not a great at it it was 4 sessions with different length and purpose. After that I got my first ever [empowerment from HH 41st  Sakya Trichen](https://www.youtube.com/live/WPp8gTxa-F4?si=VNU_Hw04IJW4Ala6).

Except that, I started my [Live coding: Rock, Code, (N)VIM](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2153861601) translations on Twitch. Going to sync it with YouTube soon.
