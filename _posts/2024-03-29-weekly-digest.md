This was a short week for me. I have a day-off today but i still publish this digest. Since I was busy with PhD studies this week still not too much other stuff.
The other achievements are
- I've learnt to use and debug Leonardo.AI queries;
- I've finished the 4 chapter of the "Golden Light Sutra", see below.
