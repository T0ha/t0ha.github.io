Since I'm in hotel these days I'm sorry about poor internet connection and issues with sound.

This week we were going on refactoring prompt types from `Ecto.Enum` to `Ecto.Association` table. We faced an issue with admin UI and decided to upgrade LiveVew library.

Next Tuesday (2024-11-05) at 9:00 UTC we are going to continue updating Phoenix framework. See you on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/war1and)  and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@AntonShvein).
