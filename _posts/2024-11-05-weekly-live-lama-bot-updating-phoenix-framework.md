This week we were working on updating Phoenix web framework for Lama Bot. 

In the evening while thinking about the strategy for the project I understood that the refactoring and updating seems to take too long.

I'm going home to Perm this weekend so we are shifting the timezone as well.

So next Tuesday (2024-11-12) at 8:00 UTC we are going to move the refactoring to a brunch and finish working on followup (periodic) messages. See you on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/war1and) and [YouTube](https://youtube.com/live/ajYG5RLPb-Q?feature=share). If I have enough time I'll try to stream to [X (Twitter)](https://x.com/T0ha666) as well.
