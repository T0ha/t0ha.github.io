This week we were working on a bit boring thing - writing tests. Thanks to active communication ing chat that added an element of AMA to the stream.

On marketing and analytics side I was actively promoting [the bot](https://lamabot.io?utm_source=t0ha.ru&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=weekly250318). As a result we have 9 new users (38 in total) from 111 page visits and 39 CTA button clicks. Looks like we are loosing between landing page and `/start` command.

The other exciting news are that I've passed test for the 1st semester of [Nalanda Diploma Course batch 5](https://tibethouse.in/ndc/). I write it here because it's a bit related to Lama Bot study.

Next Tuesday (2025-03-25) at 10:00 UTC we are going to continue adding tests. 
See you on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/war1and) and [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/@AntonShvein).
