{% picture "{{page.image}}" --alt Lama Bot user engagement %}


It was a bit overwhelming week for me due to personal reasons.  So we had no livestream. But I've done a bit of work for [Lama Bot](https://t.me/compassion_lama_bot):
- I've bought a domain [lamabot.io](https://lamabot.io);
- I've fixed followup messages that we broke on previous session;
- I started to work on landing page.

Next Tuesday (2025-02-11) at 9:00 UTC we are going to work on landing page. Pls, be active in chat it helps  Lama Bot and livestream become more popular.

See you on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/war1and).
