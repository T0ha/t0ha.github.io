Today is the 63rd anniversary of the first successful crewed spaceflight. 
However, I'm not completely sure it made human beings really better or happier at least in long-term.

This week I've started to work on an idea of "བླ་མ། Lama" bot and [Buddha is my therapist channel](https://t.me/Buddha_is_my_theropist_ru) for Telegram. I start it in Russian for now but it's going to be English as well soon. The aim is to help people cope with depression and burnout and get back to emotional balance. It's based on my own experience. It's going to be completely free and open source project.
