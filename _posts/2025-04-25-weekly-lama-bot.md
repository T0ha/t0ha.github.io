### Accomplishments of the week

This week was devoted to launch on Product Hunt. We are on the 81st place in daily ratings with 8 upvotes. The other thing is that now we have a SEO link from PH site. But it's a bit pity that there are no feedback at all. No comments just upvotes.

We are greatful to everyone who supported us.

### Livestream Announcement

In 2 weeks on Tuesday (2025-05-13) at 10:00 UTC we are going to continue working on tests and code quality. See you on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/war1and) .
