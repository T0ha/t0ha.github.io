![Baltic shore]({{page.image}})

üíª I had difficulties with connecting to my client's network through Cloudflare's ZeroTrust so I decided to spin up IPSec IKEv2 server for myself to avoid issues in future. Right now it works fine but there are some difficulties with LTE connected clients. 

‚òÄÔ∏èThis is one of the hottest ü•µ weeks of my summer. So mostly beach and a bit of swimming even though Baltic see is still cold ü•∂ a bit.

üèÉ I've done 2 + 1 km this week. I'm close to the month's goal üéØ.

üî¨ I've fixed issue in "soil to skin" HHRA model part. Now it works perfect.

üìΩÔ∏è No streams this week. But you can look moments and previous livestreams on [Twitch.](https://www.twitch.tv/war1and) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX764RemXwZZ_XfWfV8tq1PvoM4Ebcdo8).

ü™∑ This was a week for compassion and shamatha. I've never forgotten about Tara's mantras as well.

ü§ñ I've succeeded with translating articles for the blog with [Taskade AI](https://www.taskade.com/?via=t0hashvein). Going to automate social media routines as well.

 üìø [Lama Bot (‡Ωë‡æ≥‡ºã‡Ωò‡ºã‡Ωñ‡Ωº‡Ωè‡ºç)](https://t.me/compassion_lama_bot) has 5 daily active users for now. It's definitely a success! I've updated it to use GPT-4o this week. I'm going on trying to enhance it's algorythms.
