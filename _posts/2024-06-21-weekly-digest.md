![Kant's cathedral]({{page.image}})

üíª I've finished the timings and complexity issue in [TelemetryMetricsMnesia](https://github.com/T0ha/telemetry_metrics_mnesia) library for Elixir and integrating it into client's software.

üèÉ We are running 1.5 or 2x1 km. We are a bit behind the schedule but that's not a great deal.

üî¨ It's vacations now. Going to have a bit of rest from it then start to work on software and models.

üåÑ I'm travelling around Kaliningrad region. I've visited Kalinigrad several times, Yantarnoe former Palmnicken, Svetlogorsk former Rauschen. The places are very beautiful. Watched amber mining process. 

üìΩÔ∏è  I've been streaming  [Rock. Code. (N)VIM.](https://www.twitch.tv/war1and) on daily basis this week. Publishing the sessions to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX764RemXwZZ_XfWfV8tq1PvoM4Ebcdo8). But seems for now I've finished opensource work. Next streams are going to be announced soon.

ü™∑ This was a week of Loving kindness practice mostly. I've been practicing daily.

ü§ñ I've mostly succeeded with making  [Taskade AI](https://www.taskade.com/?via=t0hashvein) translating posts for this blog. I't's going to be dual language soon .

 üìø [Lama Bot (‡Ωë‡æ≥‡ºã‡Ωò‡ºã‡Ωñ‡Ωº‡Ωè‡ºç)](https://t.me/compassion_lama_bot) has 3 - 4 daily active users for now. Adding more NLP analytics to it.
