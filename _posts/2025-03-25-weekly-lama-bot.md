I was mostly busy with marketing part this week. I've submitted [Lama Bot](https://lamabot.io?utm_source=t0ha.ru&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=weekly) to [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/lama-bot) and [uneed.best](https://www.uneed.best). 
We are launching on Product Hunt on Apr, 22 (Tue) and going to do a big AMA on  [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/war1and).

Except that I created a list of 100 Telegram bot directories to register my bot in and started the process.
