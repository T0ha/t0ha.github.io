{% picture "{{page.image}}" --alt Perm marathon 2024 %}

This is probably last weekly digest in the blog. It seems like this format here is pointless and is suitable mostly for social networks.

üíª  Working hard on LiveBook based documentation for my client. There is a sort of issue accessing dependences' `priv` directory files in LiveBook. This adds a sort of frustration for  macro-rich code execution.

üèÉ We did it again! Our running season is finished with Perm marathon. The result is 5km in 36min and a lot of fun.

üî¨ Started another scholar year wit writing a paper on math models used in my thesesis.

üìΩÔ∏è We've added a personality of Lama Bot to LLM and started working on commands and first introduction message last Tuesday. Lama Bot was already reborn. Now we need to train and teach it to grow lama (‡Ωë‡æ≥‡ºã‡Ωò‡ºã) from the child. You can watch it [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/JmITGNuLhAY?si=GqxuA4fYl2Gb9zDT). Next Tue (17.09.24) we are going to continue with introduction and other special messages and do other tunning of the Bot. See you on [Twitch.](https://www.twitch.tv/war1and)

ü™∑ I've mostly practiced shamatha.

 üìø Happy Rebirth [Lama Bot (‡Ωë‡æ≥‡ºã‡Ωò‡ºã‡Ωñ‡Ωº‡Ωè‡ºç)](https://t.me/compassion_lama_bot)! üéÇüéâ See you in public telegram soon.
