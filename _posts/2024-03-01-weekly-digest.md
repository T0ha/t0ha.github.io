Happy spring! 
This week was the last week of long-long winter (it's a leap year anyhow) and the first one of a spring. 
It's different for me as I became 1 year older! Yeah my birthday was on Wed and it was awesome. Thanks to my darling wife.
Other achievements of the week are: 
- I've created a basic automation for my Social media management. I'm really bad at this type of things but I understand that I need to have something. So I decided to use [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/join?referral_code=1CYtTzjkst0mgZGYbiDr5fl4e0w110yd) as a sort of SMM manager for myself.
- I've mostly migrated my main tool NVIM from unsupported Packer to Lazy. I'll share a post a bit later.
## Weekly Learn
