üíª I was mostly busy investigating performance bottleneck in production cluster for a client.

üèÉ We ran twice 3x1 and 4x1.

üìä I've invested a big bunch of time designing my portfolio model which can help me to understand and plan my investments.

üìΩÔ∏è On Tue I'd a livestream about integrating Google's Gemini into Elixir application of  [Lama Bot (‡Ωë‡æ≥‡ºã‡Ωò‡ºã‡Ωñ‡Ωº‡Ωè‡ºç)](https://t.me/compassion_lama_bot). You can watch it [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/8osAamu3GlU?si=XxyJMJBisb5qpzOc).
Next Tuesday (30.07.24) we are going to connect the whole pipeline from user's message from Telegram to response to user. See you on [Twitch.](https://www.twitch.tv/war1and)

üåÑ I visited  [Amber museum of Kalinigrad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaliningrad_Regional_Amber_Museum). It's a very interesting place from several points. At first, it's situated in an ancient fortress built by ¬†Karl Friedrich Emil zu Dohna-Schlobitten. Secondly, there are a lot of amazing artworks made of amber and other materials inside. On weekend we travelled to [Baltiysk](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltiysk&ved=2ahUKEwjy9PC93cSHAxX_FRAIHYV3BjIQFnoECDgQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2eiOfacMxXovQ2QqA1Jd3W). We had a boat trip around it. It's exciting.
 
ü™∑ My daily practice was shamatha. As well I've studied a couple of sources from "Lion's Roar".

 üìø [Lama Bot (‡Ωë‡æ≥‡ºã‡Ωò‡ºã‡Ωñ‡Ωº‡Ωè‡ºç)](https://t.me/compassion_lama_bot) is going to move to its own architecture from Coze soon. Hopefuly, I'll handle the process until September. You are welcome to follow the process on [Twitch.](https://www.twitch.tv/war1and), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8osAamu3GlU&list=PLX764RemXwZZ_XfWfV8tq1PvoM4Ebcdo8&pp=gAQBiAQB) and other social media.
