This week we were finishing refactoring of the code to avoid duplication between ordinary user messages and chatbot commands pipelines. After that we made basic `Oban` integration into the project and started creating `Oban.Worker` for periodic messages sending to enhance user engagement.

Next Tuesday (2024-10-08) at 9:00 UTC we are going to continue working on Oban workflows. See you on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/war1and) .
