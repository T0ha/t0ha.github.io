This week we were adding log in into admin panel through a link sent to users telegram.

This is a final month of the year. I'm a bit burnt out so I've made a decision that I'm going to a vacation mode. We won't have live sessions this year. I'll do a couple of small fixes myself and deploy Lama Bot before the New 2025 Year so you can start testing it as soon as possible. 

I need a couple of time to reflect this year and make some plans and assumptions for the next one as well.

See you next year. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.
