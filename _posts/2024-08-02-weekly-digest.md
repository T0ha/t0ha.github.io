This week was sort for me. I had a day off on Fri, so I publish this digest on Mon. But the week was very productive anyhow.

üíª I was working on dataflow mapping for one of the client's project. It's a bit boring but very useful for correct caching and invalidation. Fixing bugs as well.

üèÉ We achieved 2x2km. And a short üö¥ tour on Sat.

üìä I continue to develop my portfolio adjustment model. Its long-run work with longterm results.

üìΩÔ∏è On Tue we were working together on logging users' messages from telegram to Bot's DB for using them in LLM in the next step. You can watch it [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/5iGhIJSzm7s). We are going to continue next Tue (6.08.24). See you on [Twitch.](https://www.twitch.tv/war1and)

üåÑ We went to Aistovo and had a lot of fun there. After thart we visited Gur'evsk. It's a small town with 2 amazing parks. One for different science related installations and the other with colourful light art.

ü™∑ My daily practice was shamatha. As well I've studied a couple of sources from "Lion's Roar".

 üìø [Lama Bot (‡Ωë‡æ≥‡ºã‡Ωò‡ºã‡Ωñ‡Ωº‡Ωè‡ºç)](https://t.me/compassion_lama_bot) is in progress of transition to self-hosted infrastructure. You are welcome to follow the process on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/war1and), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8osAamu3GlU&list=PLX764RemXwZZ_XfWfV8tq1PvoM4Ebcdo8&pp=gAQBiAQB) and other social media.
