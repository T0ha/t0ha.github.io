This week we were debugging periodic message sending and refactoring prompt types from `Ecto.Enum` to separate table with association. 

Next Tuesday (2024-10-22) I have a flight to Sochi. I'm not sure if I have ability to stream.
If everything is fine see you at 9:00 UTC on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/war1and) or [YouTube](https://youtube.com/live/v67IVLS160U?feature=share) and let's finish the refactoring. If something will go wrong I'll try my best to inform you in [Twitter (X)](https://twitter.com/war1and) or [Mastadon](https://mastodon.social/@t0ha).
