This week we finished log in routine for admin through link sent to telegram. We worked a bit on code quality: 
- fixed warnings,
- formatted code,
- added credo and dialyzer.

Next Tuesday (2025-01-28) at 9:00 UTC we are going to make followup messages a bit less annoying for users and continue working on code quality fixing credo issues and adding type specs. 

See you on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/war1and) and [YouTube](https://youtube.com/live/ajYG5RLPb-Q?feature=share).
