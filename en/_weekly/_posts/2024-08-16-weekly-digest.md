üíª This week is a week of [Livebook](https://livebook.dev) . It's awesome. I use it 
- for my clients onboarding workflow designing, 
- for my PhD for Ecological risk assessment modelling 
- and for crypto market research. 
This is not a complete list of usecases for it. I really love it.


üèÉ No new achievements. Only 2x2km.

üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è At the end of seashore living season me and my son went sup surfing. It's a very nice activity.

üî¨ I've finished contaminator substances selection UI. Moving to Environment UI.

üìΩÔ∏è We were working on generating user reply with Gemini LLM based on dialug history from Ecto last Tuesday. You can watch it [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/gZANqAuVEao?si=XBmI77LR6RkbPUSk)). I'm going to skip livestreams next 2 weeks because I have flights at this time. See you in September. Probably, the schedule is going to be changed due to my time zone change.

ü™∑ I was practicing shamatha and loving kindness.

üèä This was a hot week for August. So we swam a lot.

 üìø [Lama Bot (‡Ωë‡æ≥‡ºã‡Ωò‡ºã‡Ωñ‡Ωº‡Ωè‡ºç)](https://t.me/compassion_lama_bot)  is in progress of transition to self-hosted infrastructure.
