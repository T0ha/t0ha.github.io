First of all, you are welcome to try [Lama Bot](https://t.me/compassion_lama_bot)!

This week I was busy with
- fixing issue in followup messages that causes sending them several times for some users;
- fixing sending and saving message process to store message data from telegram;
- adding PostHog for analytics.

And promotion in social networks as usual.

Not too much but the most annoying ones.
