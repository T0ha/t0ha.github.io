This week we were working on `Oban.Worker` for sending periodic messages to users. We added logic for creating jobs when new user register. But we haven't finished debugging yet.

Next Tuesday (2024-10-15) at 9:00 UTC we are going to continue debugging the job. After that we are going to move to admin side. Maybe I'll try to stream to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/AntonShvein) as well. See you on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/war1and) .
