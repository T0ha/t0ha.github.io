If you follow me you maybe know that I started my live streamer's journey at the begining of this year. At first I just did live coding sessions called ["Rock. Code. (N)VIM." on Twitch.](https://www.twitch.tv/war1and). After a while I started to publish the sessions to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX764RemXwZZ_XfWfV8tq1PvoM4Ebcdo8). 
Since I mostly stream weekly my views count grew week to week until October, 14 when it fall down rapidly. ðŸ‘‡

## What happened?

At this time I switched from publishing videos from Twitch to YouTube to streaming to both Twitch and YouTube at once. During setting up YouTube livestream configuration I decided that I do and tell nothing bad so they are good for children.  I thought if I put *"yes"* for *"video for kids"* it will make video's audience wider. As a result for the next month I had less than 10 daily viewers, sometimes even 0. I start to think it was a shadowban. 

On the Nov, 16 I've uploaded my [first  shorts video](https://youtube.com/shorts/eStm6niMlxo?feature=share) and shared it on my [X (Twitter)](https://x.com/T0ha666). I've got a couple of positive responses there but only 2 views. This was too strange and made me investigate. What I discovered that YouTube show my video only to 12 potential viewers. Seems too small to make it popular.

I was shocked. Not sure why but I decided to change the "video for kids" to "no". The results was and still is amazing. You can see them in the top post image. ðŸ‘†

I changed this setting for my livestream and live recordings. My [channel](http://www.youtube.com/@AntonShvein) was reborn. That's awesome.
