I have never been a fan of Spotlight and keyboard-only workflows but one application changed completely the way I'm doing things right now. 

A couple of weeks ago my attention was captured by some material [Raycast AI](https://www.raycast.com) . I was interested and installed the app on my mac. My first impression was that it could do so many things out of the box even without AI and Pro plan. I started to press `Cmd-Space` shortcut more often. I configured it a lot for myself. 

At some point, a spirit of a junior developer came to me and said: "Let's do as much as possible with Raycast!". Isn't it familiar? Sounds like, "Let's create an OS in Brainfuck!" 

Later  I switched from just installing and configuring stuff to workflow-oriented approach. I reintroduced  mindfulness to my daily routine. 

I started to question: 
- What am I doing too often?
- How do I do it?
- Is there a way to automate it or make the way I'm doing it more productive?
- What simple actions could help?

I'm still following this endless path but I've already achieved a couple of milestones along the way.

## What Changed?

I mostly cleared the hell of browser tabs  moving most of the commonly used pages to Browser bookmarks or Raycast's `quick links`.

I cleared a chaos of always open applications and files by adding them to `quick links` or even adding scripts for automation.

I added a sound notification after each command finishes, like `espeak "Finished $(basename ${PWD})"` to my `.zshrc`. It allows me to work on other tasks while time-consuming compilations or tests are running.

I'm in progress of changing the settings of `iterm`, `tmux` and other stuff in order to make the titles of windows,  tabs and panes more informative.

I updated my email folders and filters to be aligned with current subscriptions. Now I can check only several important emails a day and read mail lists when I have time and need them.

I created, but still haven't published [Raycast extension to manage Publora](https://github.com/T0ha/publora-raycast). You can review it on my GitHub for now. It helps me to be more present in social media since I'm not a fan of them.

I started to use AI through Raycast and [GH Copilot](https://github.com/copilot) intensively. Before that I just played a bit with it. Now I try to use it instead of Googling and for writing or fixing simple code, tests and docs. I don't completely rely AI but it's good as an advanced autocompletion and snippet tool.

## Conclusion

As you can see, not all of the changes are related to Raycast itself, but it was a trigger for these changes. I'm going to describe some of them in the following articles. The process is going on...
