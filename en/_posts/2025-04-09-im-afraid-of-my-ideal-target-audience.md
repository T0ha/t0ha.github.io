As you know, I'm building in public [Lama Bot (དླ་མ་བོཏ།)](https://lamabot.io?utm_source=t0ha.ru&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=afraid-ita) for a bit less than a year now. Its second version based on its on platform was deployed 3 months ago. Now it has about 10 weekly active users. 

When I was planning the project I aimed it to help people to coupe with depression, burnout and other negative mental conditions. There are at least 3 ways it could help:
- by providing compassionate support;
- by helping with decision providing appropriate Buddhist or general wisdom;
- by suggesting Buddhist practice, helping to overcome hard emotional state.

For now it mostly does first two points and third one is very simple. It looks like it's a good moment to go to my target audience in social media but...

...when I navigate to [r/depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/) or other similar communities and start reading posts there like *"I'm going to kill myself ..."* a cold wave of fear passes through my body. I'm frozen. I'm so afraid to hurt these people that I even can't write a comment of support there. 

BTW, the project was born from my own depression experience. I remember myself walking home from my office when suddenly I realised that regrets about surviving from COVID is not correct mental state.

What shell I do? I really need your advice.
