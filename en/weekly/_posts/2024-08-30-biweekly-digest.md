This digest is a bit unusual because it's biweekly. I haven't posted the week before but these two weeks have a lot in common. I spent them on my way home with short vacations in Moscow region in between.

üíª Only occasional work on urgent questions.

üèÉ Due to schedule and hot weather we run only once and inside. It was 3km on the threadmill.

üìΩÔ∏è Live streaming is on vacations as well. See you on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/war1and) on Sep, 3. I'll check the time later according to my current TZ. You can watch previous streams on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8osAamu3GlU&list=PLX764RemXwZZ_XfWfV8tq1PvoM4Ebcdo8&pp=gAQBiAQB).

ü™∑ My practice is a bit poorer this week. I've missed some days and mostly practiced shamatha.

üåÑ We've visited the Red Square,  [New Jerusalem Monastery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jerusalem_Monastery) and New Istra Resort. It was a joyful vacations.

 üìø [Lama Bot (‡Ωë‡æ≥‡ºã‡Ωò‡ºã‡Ωñ‡Ωº‡Ωè‡ºç)](https://t.me/compassion_lama_bot) is in progress of transition to self-hosted infrastructure. It was paused due to vacations as well. We are going to continue next week.
