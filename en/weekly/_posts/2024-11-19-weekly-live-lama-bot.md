This week we were rolling back phoenix update and prompts types refactoring in order to ship Lama Bot before the New Year. We are going to work on update stuff later if needed.

Next Tuesday () at 9:00 UTC we are going to fix followup messages, build release and Docker container for the deployment. See you on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/war1and) and [YouTube](https://youtube.com/live/B7Wlro9RHSk?feature=share). If I have enough time I'll try to stream to [X (Twitter)](https://x.com/T0ha666) as well.
