üíª Was mostly busy with bugfixing. Added image preprocessing to this blog.

üèÉ We ran only once on Sat. It was 1 + 1 + about 1. We are behind the plan.

üî¨ I was busy reworking my PhD modelling LiveBook UI.

üìΩÔ∏è I've missed livestream this week because of other urgent stuff, sorry for that.

ü™∑  I've practiced shamatha. 

ü§ñ I was investigating HuggingFace for usage for PhD and Lama Bot projects.

 üìø [Lama Bot (‡Ωë‡æ≥‡ºã‡Ωò‡ºã‡Ωñ‡Ωº‡Ωè‡ºç)](https://t.me/compassion_lama_bot) is in progress of transition to self-hosted infrastructure. Most of the week was investigating ways of hosting LLM by myself but decided that it's too expensive for non-profit indie project. So for now I'm going to use Google's Gemini.

## Weekly Learn
Here what I've learnt this week. It's a collection of materials  in several languages with my comments.

### Books
I'm finishing Alan Wallace's "The Four Immeasurables: Practices to Open the Heart". Only one chapter is left about wisdom.
