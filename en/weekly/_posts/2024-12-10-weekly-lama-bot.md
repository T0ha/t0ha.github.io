I've taken vacations in live streaming but I still work hard to make new version of Lama Bot ready to help you asap. 

This week I was busy with 3 types of activities:
- I've deployed test version of Lama Bot to Digital Ocean and set it up;
- My friends and family is busy testing it;
- I'm trying to inform users of old Lama that it's going to be moved to a new platform so they need to write it a message to continue using it;
- I'm doing marketing work in social media.
